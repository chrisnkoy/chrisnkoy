Hi, Iâ€™m Christian!
I am a recent computer science graduate looking to pursue a career in software engineering. I love problem-solving and technology. I am comfortable using Java and Python. I am currently learning front-end web development with HTM/CSS & JavaScript/React. Contributions are more than welcome.
